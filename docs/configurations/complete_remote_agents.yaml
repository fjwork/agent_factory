# multi-agent orchestration capabilities.

remote_agents:
  # Data Analysis Agent - Handles complex data processing and visualization
  - name: "data_analysis_agent"
    description: "Handles complex data analysis, statistical computations, data visualization, and reporting tasks"
    agent_card_url: "http://localhost:8002/a2a/data_analysis_agent"
    enabled: true

  # Notification Agent - Manages communications and alerts

# Configuration Notes:
# - Set enabled: false to disable a specific agent without removing its configuration
# - agent_card_url should point to the base A2A endpoint (/.well-known/agent-card.json will be appended automatically)
# - Each agent should run on a different port to avoid conflicts
# - Authentication context is automatically forwarded when delegating tasks

# To disable all remote agents:
# Comment out the entire remote_agents section or set it to an empty list:
# remote_agents: []
