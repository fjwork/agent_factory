# Development Configuration Notes:
# - All agents run on localhost for easy development
# - Debug mode enabled for detailed logging and troubleshooting
# - Mock providers used to avoid external service dependencies
# - Auto-approval enabled for testing workflow scenarios
# - Experimental features can be safely tested

# Development Environment Variables:
# You may want to set these environment variables for development:
# export LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
# export DEVELOPMENT_MODE="true"
# export MOCK_EXTERNAL_SERVICES="true"
# export AUTO_APPROVE_WORKFLOWS="true"

# Development Testing:
# This configuration is designed to work with the test suite:
# - python testing/test_root_agent.py
# - python testing/test_remote_agents/test_*.py
# - python testing/test_auth_forwarding.py

# Hot Reloading:
# For development, you can start agents with hot reloading:
# uvicorn module.agent:app --reload --port 8002

# Development Tools Integration:
# - Compatible with VS Code debugging
# - Works with pytest for automated testing
# - Supports profiling and performance analysis
# - Includes request/response logging for API debugging
